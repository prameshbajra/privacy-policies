# User Data Deletion Policy

### 1. Introduction

This User Data Deletion Policy ("Policy") explains our practices regarding the deletion of user data, the conditions under which we delete data, and how our users can initiate the data deletion process.

### 2. Scope

This Policy applies to all data that **Voice Summary App** collects, stores, and processes on its users.

### 3. Data Deletion Request

Users can request the deletion of their personal data:

a) By sending an email to _suzalbajra@gmail.com_ with the subject line "Data Deletion Request".

### 4. Data Deletion Process

Upon receiving a data deletion request, **Voice Summary App** will:

a) Verify the identity of the requester to ensure the security and privacy of our users.
c) Delete the user's data within 30 days of verification unless there's a valid reason to retain certain data (e.g., for legal compliance, dispute resolution, or security reasons).
d) Notify the user via email once the data deletion process is complete.

### 5. Data Retention Period

If users do not actively use **Voice Summary App** for [e.g., 12 consecutive months], we may consider their account inactive and reserve the right to delete the user's data after notifying them via their registered email address.
